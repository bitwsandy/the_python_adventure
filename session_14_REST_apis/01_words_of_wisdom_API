An API, which stands for Application Programming Interface,
is like a bridge that allows two different software programs to talk to
each other.

Imagine you are at a restaurant, and you want to order food. You don't go
into the kitchen to prepare the food yourself. Instead, you look at the
menu, choose what you want, and then tell the waiter.
The waiter takes your order to the kitchen, and when the food is ready,
the waiter brings it back to you.

In this example:
- You are the software program that wants something.
- The kitchen is the other software that can give you what you need.
- The waiter is the API, which takes your request, delivers it to the kitchen, and brings back the result.

So, an API helps different software programs communicate and work
together without you needing to know how the other software works
internally. Itâ€™s a way for programs to request and exchange information
easily.
