 1. Technical Definition:
      - REST is an architectural style for designing networked
        applications.
      - It relies on a stateless, client-server communication protocol,
        most commonly HTTP.
      - In RESTful services, resources are identified by URLs, and they
        are manipulated using standard HTTP methods such as
        GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
      - The responses are typically in formats like JSON or XML.

 2. Simplified Definition:
      - REST is a set of rules for how web services should communicate.
      - It defines how systems can interact with each other over the web
        in a simple, predictable way using standard web protocols like
        HTTP.

 3. Developer-Friendly Definition:
      - REST is a way to build APIs that is both easy to use and scalable.
      - It uses URLs to identify resources and HTTP methods to interact
        with them.
      - By following REST principles, developers can create APIs that are
        intuitive and work well across different platforms and devices.

 4. Business-Oriented Definition:
      - REST is a framework that enables the creation of web services that
        can easily be integrated into various applications.
      - It allows businesses to expose their services over the internet
        in a standardized way, facilitating integration with other services
        and improving interoperability.

 5. Layman's Definition:
      - REST is a method used to make web services talk to each other.
      - It works by sending requests and getting responses over the web,
        similar to how you browse websites, but for software applications.

 6. Academic Definition:
      - REST is an architectural style defined by Roy Fielding in his
        doctoral dissertation.
      - It emphasizes a uniform interface, stateless interactions, and the
        use of standard HTTP protocols for web-based communication between
        clients and servers.

 7. Metaphorical Definition:
      - REST is like a well-organized library where each book (resource)
        has a specific place (URL), and you can use standard actions like
        checking out, returning, or updating the books, all following a
        clear and consistent set of rules.
