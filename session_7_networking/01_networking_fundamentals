1. What is a Network?
        - A network is a group of computers and other devices connected to each other to
          share resources electronically.
        - Networks can range from a small home setup with a few devices to massive, global
          internet.


2. IP Addresses and Ports
        - IP Address:
              This is a unique identifier assigned to each device on a network. It's like
              the address of a house on the internet. There are two types of IP addresses:
        - IPv4:
                An IP address in this category looks like `192.168.1.1`.
        - IPv6:
                A newer format that looks like `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`.
        - Port:
                A port is a numerical value used to uniquely identify different services
                on a single device using IP. For example, web servers usually use port 80
                for HTTP.

3. TCP/IP Protocol
        - TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):
                This is a fundamental protocol for network communication that ensures
                reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of bytes between
                applications running on hosts communicating via an IP network. TCP is used
                by SSH for its reliability.
        - IP (Internet Protocol): This protocol handles addressing and routing the data
                packets from sender to receiver. TCP works with IP, which is why they are
                often mentioned together as TCP/IP.

4. SSH (Secure Shell)
        - SSH is a protocol that provides a secure way to access a network service over an
          unsecured network. It uses encryption to secure the connection from eavesdropping,
          connection hijacking, and other attacks.
        - Key Features:
            - Authentication: Verifying the identity of the connected party.
            - Encryption: Keeping the data confidential during transmission.
            - Integrity: Ensuring the data is not altered in transit.

5. Public Key Cryptography
        - This type of cryptography uses a pair of keys for encryption:
                - A public key and a private key.
                - The public key can be shared with anyone, while the private key must be
                  kept secret.
        - In the context of SSH and Paramiko, public key cryptography is used for
          authenticating users and hosts, ensuring that only authorized users can access
          the server.


6. Client-Server Model
        - In this model, "clients" request services from "servers". For instance,
          an SSH client like Paramiko might request to execute commands on an SSH server.
        - The server listens on a network address for incoming requests
          (e.g., IP address plus a port number like 22 for SSH) and responds to them.


7. Using Paramiko
        - Paramiko as a Client:
            - It can connect to an SSH server, authenticate (either by password or using keys)
              , and execute commands or transfer files.
        - Paramiko as a Server:
            - Rarely, but it can be configured to act as an SSH server to accept connections
              and manage commands or file transfers from clients.
