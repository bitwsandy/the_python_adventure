        SSH, or Secure Shell, is a cryptographic network protocol used primarily for secure
remote login and other secure network services over an insecure network.
It replaces older, insecure remote shell protocols such as Telnet, rlogin, and rsh.
Here are some of the key features and uses of SSH:

1. Secure Remote Access:
        - The primary use of SSH is to securely access and operate machines over the internet.
        - It allows users to log in to another computer over a network, execute commands, and
          move files.

2. Encryption:
        - SSH provides strong encryption of data, ensuring that sensitive information is not
          exposed to eavesdropping, connection hijacking, and other attacks.

3. Integrity and Authentication:
        - Along with encryption, SSH also ensures the integrity of the data transferred over
          the network and verifies the identity of the host or user, typically using passwords,
          cryptographic keys, or both.

4. Port Forwarding/Tunneling:
        - SSH allows forwarding of TCP ports and tunneling non-SSH connections over an
          encrypted channel.
        - This is useful for securely transmitting information from other protocols
          (like HTTP, FTP, etc.) over SSH.

5. File Transfer:
        - Although not a part of the original SSH protocol, file transfer capabilities have
          been added with protocols like SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) and SCP
          (Secure Copy Protocol) that run over an SSH connection.

6. Command Execution:
        - SSH can be used to execute commands on a remote machine without logging into a
          standard shell session.
        - This is useful for automating tasks across many machines through scripts.
