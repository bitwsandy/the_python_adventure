    Paramiko is a Python library that provides an implementation of the SSHv2 protocol,
allowing users to connect and manage remote servers securely. It supports both client-side
and server-side components of the SSH protocol.

Here are some key features of Paramiko:

1. SSH Client and Server:
        - It can be used to implement SSH clients and servers, facilitating secure
          connections for executing commands, transferring files, and forwarding ports over
          encrypted channels.

2. SFTP Client:
        - Paramiko includes support for SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol), enabling secure
          file transfer operations between the local and remote systems.

3. Key Management:
        - It supports various forms of key management, including loading and saving SSH keys,
          and it can work with keys in the PEM format used by OpenSSL.

4. Security:
        - It uses PyCrypto or cryptography libraries to handle encryption, ensuring a secure
          connection.

5. Channel Multiplexing:
        - Paramiko allows multiple channels over a single SSH connection, which can be used
          for different purposes like shell commands, file transfers, and port forwarding.

    Paramiko is commonly used in automation scripts, network management, and anywhere Python
scripts need to interact with systems accessible via SSH.
