# What is Flask?
    - Flask is a popular Python web framework designed for building web applications.
    - It belongs to a category of software known as "web frameworks," which are tools
      that provide functionalities to develop websites quickly and easily,
      handling everything from simple web pages to complex web services.

# Understanding Web Frameworks
        A web framework provides a structured way to build web applications. It offers libraries and modules which simplify common web development tasks such as:
            - Routing URLs to appropriate handler functions
            - Managing user sessions
            - Interacting with databases
            - Rendering HTML templates

# Flask's Role in Web Development
        - Flask is categorized as a "micro-framework" because it aims to keep the core
          simple but extensible.
        - It provides basic tools and libraries that you need to build an application,
          but it doesn't enforce a project or database layout.
        - This minimalistic approach makes Flask flexible and easy to adapt to
          developersâ€™ needs, which is particularly useful for small projects or when
          learning web development.
        - However, it can also scale up to complex applications through extensions
          that add additional functionalities like form validation,
          user authentication, and more.

# Key Characteristics of Flask
        - Lightweight:
                - Flask comes with only essential tools to get a web app up and running,
                  making it very lightweight.
                - This means you can add other tools and libraries according to the
                  project's requirements.
        - Modular:
                - Flask's design is modular; you can include various extensions to add
                  features such as database integration, form validation, upload
                  management, and more.
        - Flexibility:
                - Due to its simplicity and minimal design, it provides a lot of
                  flexibility, allowing you to use the components you want and integrate
                  with other libraries easily.
        - Ease of Use:
                - Flask is known for its ease of use and quick setup, making it ideal
                  for beginners in web development.

    By choosing Flask, developers can start with the simplest components and
gradually scale up to full-fledged applications using numerous extensions available
in the ecosystem.

    This makes it an excellent choice for both small projects and large-scale
applications alike.
