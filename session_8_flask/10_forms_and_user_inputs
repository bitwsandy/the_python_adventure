Introduction to Forms in Flask

How to Handle Forms in Flask:
    - Flask can handle form data sent via GET or POST methods.
    - The form data is accessible through the request object provided by Flask.
        - GET Method:
                - Typically used for searching and retrieving data.
                - Data sent via GET is visible in the URL.
        - POST Method:
                - Used for sending data securely to the server as it does not appear
                  in the URL.
                - This method is preferred for forms where data needs to be modified
                  or added.

Retrieving Form Data:
    - GET: Data is retrieved from request.args.
    - POST: Data is retrieved from request.form.
