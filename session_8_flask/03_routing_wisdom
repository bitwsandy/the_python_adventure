- Routing in a web application refers to determining what code should run when
  a user visits a specific URL.
- In Flask, this is managed using the app.route() decorator, which connects URLs to
  Python functions.
- This allows for creating a responsive web application where different URLs can lead
  to different content.

# Understanding the app.route() Decorator
- The app.route() decorator in Flask is used to bind a URL to a Python function.
- For example, when a user visits a URL, Flask checks if the URL matches any routes
  that have been defined.
- If it does, the corresponding function is executed, and its return value is sent
  back to the browser as a response.
