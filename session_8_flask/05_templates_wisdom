- Templates are a powerful feature of Flask that allow for dynamic content generation.
- They make it easy to separate the design from Python code, which enhances
  organization and maintainability.
- Flask uses Jinja2 as its templating engine.

Introduction to Jinja2 Templating (10 minutes)
    - Jinja2 is a modern and designer-friendly templating language for Python, modeled after Djangoâ€™s templates. It is fast, widely used, and secure. With Jinja2, you can use conditional statements, loops, and filters to dynamically generate HTML content from templates.

Why Use Templates?

    - Separation of Concerns:
        - Templates allow you to separate business logic from presentation, making your
          code cleaner and more maintainable.

    - Reusability:
        - You can reuse the same template in different parts of your application with
          different data.

    - Simplification:
        - Templates simplify the process of making complex HTML dynamically with
          variables and control structures.


Basic Syntax:

    - Variables can be used with {{ variable_name }}.
    - Control structures like for-loops and conditions are used with
      {% for item in list %} and {% if user %}.

Starting Up :
    - Ensure that you have a templates folder in the root directory of your Flask
      application, and that it is spelled correctly as templates.
    - This folder should be at the same level as your app.py file, not nested inside
      another directory unless explicitly configured to be so.
